<li>
<p>多选题组合选，不要一样选一个</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>一定读完所有选项，比较每个选项的区别</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>注意重点词汇，比如 MOST LATEST ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>重点甄别没见过的组件，给出令自己信服的选择理由</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you can only put ALBs in front of the web tier, not the DB tier.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GWLB is specifically designed to simplify the deployment of security appliances. Using GWLB endpoints in service
accounts ensures efficient routing and centralized inspection of traffic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TLS encrypts data only in transit, not during processing. Additionally, SSE-S3 does not meet the compliance
requirement of using client-specific encryption keys.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AWS Config cannot prevent resource creation or modification. It can detect noncompliance but requires additional tools
like Lambda for remediation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you cannot save data to EBS from Kinesis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AWS Lambda is not optimal for this use case due to its constraints on memory and runtime, particularly with large ML
models and batch requests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A NAT gateway is used for outbound traffic not inbound traffic and cannot make the application available to
internet-based clients.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CloudFront is ideal for caching static or frequently accessed content. For real-time APIs where caching is not
effective, CloudFront would not address latency issues for international users.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AWS SMS(Server Migration Service) has been deprecated in favor of AWS Application Migration Service, which provides a
more streamlined and modern approach to lift-and-shift migrations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Security groups are an instance-level firewall used for controlling access to AWS resources</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server certificates are SSL/TLS certificates that you can use to authenticate with some AWS services</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>EBS volumes are not encrypted by default</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SSL certificates will only be useful to encrypt data in transit, not data at rest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can only specify one launch configuration for an EC2 Auto Scaling group at a time, and you can&#x27;t modify a launch
configuration after you&#x27;ve created it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When setting up an ASG with a combined purchasing model, you can specify the base capacity of the group to be
fulfilled by On-Demand instances. As the ASG scales in or scales out, EC2 Auto Scaling ensures the base capacity is
fulfilled using On-Demand instances and anything beyond that be fulfilled with either only Spot instances or a
specified percentage mix of On-Demand or Spot instances.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You cannot manually associate or disassociate a public IP address from your instance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You cannot change the CMK key that is used to encrypt a volume</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Though there is no minimum duration when storing data in S3 Standard, you cannot transition to Standard IA within 30
days.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AWS Global Accelerator does not directly support S3 buckets as an endpoint. Configuring Global Accelerator would
require additional infrastructure, such as custom endpoints, increasing the effort and complexity without directly
solving the latency issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>S3 File Gateway is designed for file-based workloads rather than block storage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>iSCSI = Internet Small Computer System Interface</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Amazon Security Lake is purpose-built for centralizing security data. It minimizes development effort by automatically
collecting and formatting data into the Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework (OCSF) for analysis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gateway endpoints are only for S3 and DynamoDB.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The AWS Network Firewall is a managed service that makes it easy to deploy essential network protections for all your
Amazon Virtual Private Clouds, and you can then use domain list rules to block HTTP or HTTPS traffic to domains
identified as low-reputation, or that are known or suspected to be associated with malware or botnets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AWS WAF is a web application firewall that helps protect your web applications or APIs against common web exploits and
bots that may affect availability, compromise security, or consume excessive resources. It is designed to protect your
applications from malicious traffic, not your VPC.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Amazon Redshift is better suited for analytical queries and is not optimized for real-time sentiment analysis. This
solution introduces higher costs and complexity compared to using Amazon Comprehend and DynamoDB.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RDS automated backups support up to 35 days of retention and point-in-time recovery. AWS Backup can retain backups for
120 days, it cannot directly handle point-in-time recovery, which requires native RDS automated backups.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You cannot configure a multi-AZ DB instance to run in another Region, it must be in the same Region but in a different
Availability Zone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You cannot create an RDS Read Replica of a database that is running on Amazon EC2. You can only create read replicas
of databases running on Amazon RDS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Amazon CloudFront cannot be configured with &#x27;a pair of static IP addresses&#x27;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NLB is not optimized for traffic inspection. Additionally, VPC peering lacks centralized management and scalability
for large organizations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>VPC endpoints do not inherently support routing all traffic through a centralized appliance and lack the capability
for deep packet inspection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lambda@Edge is not used to direct traffic to on-premises origins.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You cannot use self-signed certificates with RDS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Amplify is better suited for modern full-stack applications, not static web hosting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The AWS Storage Gateway Tape Gateway enables you to replace using physical tapes on premises with virtual tapes in AWS
without changing existing backup workflows. Tape Gateway emulates physical tape libraries, removes the cost and
complexity of managing physical tape infrastructure, and provides more durability than physical tapes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>EventBridge is not suitable for handling high-frequency batch image processing tasks. AWS Lambda’s limitations also
make it unsuitable for this scenario.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>detailed monitoring provides metrics at 1-minute intervals, which allows the operations team to quickly detect and
analyze potential bottlenecks during the sales event. CloudWatch natively supports metrics for both EC2 and RDS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Amazon Kinesis Data Streams should be used for near-real time or real-time use cases instead of Amazon SQS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You do not need to use the SCT as you are migrating into the same destination database engine (RDS is just the
platform).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AWS Direct Connect is used for establishing private connections between on-premises environments and AWS, not for
connecting to third-party SaaS providers within AWS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AWS Glue simplifies ETL workflows and supports attaching security configurations to enforce client-specific encryption
with KMS keys.</p>

<p>AWS Organizations provides policy-based management for multiple AWS accounts. With Organizations, you can create
member accounts that are part of your organization and centrally manage your accounts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AWS Transit Gateway connects VPCs and on-premises networks through a central hub. It is a network transit hub, not a
user authentication and management service. It doesn&#x27;t directly address the need for centralized corporate directory
service integration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Amazon Cognito is primarily used to add user sign-up, sign-in, and access control to your web and mobile apps quickly

<p>Amazon EBS fast snapshot restore (FSR) enables you to create a volume from a snapshot that is fully initialized at
creation. This eliminates the latency of I/O operations on a block when it is accessed for the first time. Volumes
that are created using fast snapshot restore instantly deliver all their provisioned performance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With EBS you can encrypt your volume and automate volume-level backups using snapshots that are run by Data Lifecycle

<p>Amazon API Gateway&#x27;s canary release deployments. This allows the company to gradually roll out the new API version,
initially exposing only a small percentage of their users to the new API. As they monitor the system and confirm that
the new API is working as expected, they can increase the percentage of traffic directed to the new version.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Amazon Aurora with MySQL compatibility is a good fit for achieving high availability and improved performance. Aurora
automatically distributes the data across multiple AZs in a single region. Additionally, Aurora allows the creation of
up to 15 Aurora Replicas that share the same underlying volume as the primary instance. Directing reporting functions
to the Aurora Replica is an effective way to offload reporting workloads from the primary database.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CloudFront signed cookies are a method to control who can access your content. When a user authenticates and is
verified as an enrolled student, the application can set a cookie in the student&#x27;s browser. The cookie contains the
same information that can be included in a signed URL but applies to multiple files in one or multiple directories.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You cannot reference a security group from another region. Security groups are region-specific and can only be
referenced within the same region.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The only solution presented that actually works is to create a NAT gateway in the public subnet of each AZ. They must
be created in the public subnet as they gain public IP addresses and use an internet gateway for internet access.
The route tables in the private subnets must then be configured with a route to the NAT gateway and then the EC2
instances will be able to access the internet (subject to security group configuration).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can associate an AWS Direct Connect gateway with either of the following gateways:</p>
<ul>
<li>A transit gateway when you have multiple VPCs in the same Region.</li>
<li>A virtual private gateway.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>AWS Service Catalog enables organizations to create and manage catalogs of IT services that are approved for use on
AWS.
It allows centrally managed service portfolios, which clients can use on a self-service basis.
AWS Service Catalog provides a single location where organizations can centrally manage catalogs of IT services, which
simplifies the organizational process and helps ensure compliance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AWS Transfer Family provides fully managed support for file transfers directly into and out of Amazon S3 using SFTP.
Storing incoming files in S3 Standard offers high durability, availability, and performance object storage for
frequently accessed data.
AWS Lambda can respond immediately to S3 events, which allows processing of files as soon as they arrive. Lambda can
also delete the files after processing. This meets all requirements and is operationally efficient, as it requires
minimal management and has low costs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Metrics Server collects resource metrics like CPU and memory usage from each node and its pods and provides these
metrics to the Kubernetes API server for use by the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler, which automatically scales the number
of pods in a deployment, replication controller, replica set, or stateful set based on observed CPU utilization.
The Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler automatically adjusts the size of the Kubernetes cluster when there are pods that
failed to run in the cluster due to insufficient resources or when there are nodes in the cluster that have been
underutilized for an extended period and their pods can be placed on other existing nodes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can use the CloudWatch agent to collect both system metrics and log files from Amazon EC2 instances and
on-premises servers. The agent supports both Windows Server and Linux, and enables you to select the metrics to be
collected, including sub-resource metrics such as per-CPU core.
There is now a unified agent and previously there were monitoring scripts. Both of these tools can capture
SwapUtilization metrics and send them to CloudWatch. This is the best way to get memory utilization metrics from
Amazon EC2 instnaces.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enable detailed monitoring in the EC2 console. Create an Amazon CloudWatch SwapUtilization custom metric. Monitor
SwapUtilization metrics in CloudWatch&quot; is incorrect as you do not create custom metrics in the console, you must
configure the instances to send the metric information to CloudWatch.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AWS DataSync is a secure, online service that automates and accelerates moving data between on-premises and AWS
storage service and is not designed as a hybrid storage service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you launch a new EC2 instance, the EC2 service attempts to place the instance in such a way that all of your
instances are spread out across underlying hardware to minimize correlated failures. You can use placement groups to
influence the placement of a group of interdependent instances to meet the needs of your workload. Depending on the
type of workload, you can create a placement group using one of the following placement strategies:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Cluster – packs instances close together inside an Availability Zone. This strategy enables workloads to achieve
the
low-latency network performance necessary for tightly-coupled node-to-node communication that is typical of HPC
applications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Partition – spreads your instances across logical partitions such that groups of instances in one partition do not
share
the underlying hardware with groups of instances in different partitions. This strategy is typically used by large
distributed and replicated workloads, such as Hadoop, Cassandra, and Kafka.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spread – strictly places a small group of instances across distinct underlying hardware to reduce correlated
failures.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>You cannot enable “cross-region snapshots” as this is not a feature that currently exists.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Though snapshots (and EBS-backed AMIs) are stored on Amazon S3, you cannot actually access them using the S3 API. You
must use the EC2 API.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lambda@Edge is a feature of Amazon CloudFront that lets you run code closer to users of your application, which
improves performance and reduces latency. Lambda@Edge runs code in response to events generated by the Amazon
CloudFront.</p>
<p>You simply upload your code to AWS Lambda, and it takes care of everything required to run and scale your code with
high
availability at an AWS location closest to your end user.</p>
<p>In this case Lambda@Edge can compress the files before they are sent to users which will reduce data egress costs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enable caching on the CloudFront distribution to store generated files at the edge&quot; is incorrect. The files are unique
to each customer request, so caching does not help.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AWS AppSync simplifies application development by letting you create a flexible API to securely access, manipulate,
and combine data from one or more data sources. AppSync is a managed service that uses GraphQL to make it easy for
applications to get exactly the data they need, including from multiple DynamoDB tables.
AWS AppSync is designed for real-time and offline data access which makes it an ideal solution for this scenario.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AWS Glue is a fully managed extract, transform, and load (ETL) service that makes it easy to prepare and load your
data for analytics. However, AWS Glue isn&#x27;t meant for real-time data retrieval in an application. Using it for
real-time data retrieval would likely be overcomplicated and inefficient.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some applications, such as media catalog updates require high frequency reads, and consistent throughput. For such
applications, customers often complement S3 with an in-memory cache, such as Amazon ElastiCache for Redis, to reduce
the S3 retrieval cost and to improve performance.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>ElastiCache for Redis is a fully managed, in-memory data store that provides sub-millisecond latency performance
with
high throughput. ElastiCache for Redis complements S3 in the following ways:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Redis stores data in-memory, so it provides sub-millisecond latency and supports incredibly high requests per
second.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It supports key/value based operations that map well to S3 operations (for example, GET/SET =&gt; GET/PUT), making it
easy to write code for both S3 and ElastiCache.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It can be implemented as an application side cache. This allows you to use S3 as your persistent store and benefit
from its durability, availability, and low cost. Your applications decide what objects to cache, when to cache
them,
and how to cache them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In this example the media catalog is pulling updates from S3 so the performance between these components is what needs
to be improved. Therefore, using ElastiCache to cache the content will dramatically increase the performance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Replication enables automatic, asynchronous copying of objects across Amazon S3 buckets. Buckets that are
configured for object replication can be owned by the same AWS account or by different accounts. You can copy
objects between different AWS Regions or within the same Region. Both source and destination buckets must have
versioning enabled.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create an additional S3 bucket with versioning in another Region and configure cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)&quot;
is incorrect as CORS is not related to replication</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Amazon RDS uses snapshots for backup. Snapshots are encrypted when created only if the database is encrypted and you
can only select encryption for the database when you first create it. In this case the database, and hence the
snapshots, ad unencrypted.
However, you can create an encrypted copy of a snapshot. You can restore using that snapshot which creates a new DB
instance that has encryption enabled. From that point on encryption will be enabled for all snapshots.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server-Side Encryption with Amazon S3-Managed Keys (SSE-S3) is incorrect as the company needs to manage access
control for the keys which is not possible when they’re managed by Amazon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SSE-KMS requires that AWS manage the data key but you manage the customer master key (CMK) in AWS KMS. You can choose
a customer managed CMK or the AWS managed CMK for Amazon S3 in your account.</p>
<p>Customer managed CMKs are CMKs in your AWS account that you create, own, and manage. You have full control over these
CMKs, including establishing and maintaining their key policies, IAM policies, and grants, enabling and disabling
them, rotating their cryptographic material, adding tags, creating aliases that refer to the CMK, and scheduling the
CMKs for deletion.</p>
<p>For this scenario, the solutions architect should use SSE-KMS with a customer managed CMK. That way KMS will manage
the data key but the company can configure key policies defining who can access the keys.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA)
• Improved ENA for HPC, only works for Linux
• Great for inter-node communications, tightly coupled workloads
• Leverages Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard
• Bypasses the underlying Linux OS to provide low-latency, reliable transport</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Amazon S3 Access Points, a feature of S3, simplify data access for any AWS service or customer application that stores
data in S3. With S3 Access Points, customers can create unique access control policies for each access point to easily
control access to shared datasets. You can also control access point usage using AWS Organizations support for AWS
SCPs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AWS Compute Optimizer helps you identify the optimal AWS resource configurations, such as Amazon Elastic Compute
Cloud (EC2) instance types, Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume configurations, and AWS Lambda function memory
sizes, using machine learning to analyze historical utilization metrics. AWS Compute Optimizer provides a set of APIs
and a console experience to help you reduce costs and increase workload performance by recommending the optimal AWS
resources for your AWS workloads.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cost and Usage Reports are a highly detailed report of your spend and usage across your entire AWS Environment. Whilst
it can be used to understand cost, it does not make recommendations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cost Explorer gives you insight into your spend and usage in a graphical format, which can be filtered and grouped by
parameters like Region, instance type and can use Tags to further group resources. It does not however make any
recommendations on how to reduce spend.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can create a read replica as a Multi-AZ DB instance. Amazon RDS creates a standby of your replica in another
Availability Zone for failover support for the replica. Creating your read replica as a Multi-AZ DB instance is
independent of whether the source database is a Multi-AZ DB instance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a user requests your content, CloudFront typically serves the requested content regardless of where the user is
located. If you need to prevent users in specific countries from accessing your content, you can use the CloudFront
geo restriction feature to do one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Allow your users to access your content only if they&#x27;re in one of the countries on a whitelist of approved
countries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prevent your users from accessing your content if they&#x27;re in one of the countries on a blacklist of banned
countries.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, if a request comes from a country where, for copyright reasons, you are not authorized to distribute your
content, you can use CloudFront geo restriction to block the request.
This is the easiest and most effective way to implement a geographic restriction for the delivery of content.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>security groups cannot block traffic by country.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accounts can be migrated between organizations. To do this you must have root or IAM access to both the member and
master accounts. Resources will remain under the control of the migrated account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Amazon OpsWorks is a fully managed configuration management service that helps you automate the deployment and
management of your applications across AWS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Amazon SWF（Simple Workflow Service ） is used for process automation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In this case the scenario requires that credentials are used for authenticating to MySQL. The credentials need to be
securely stored outside of the function code. Systems Manager Parameter Store provides secure, hierarchical storage
for configuration data management and secrets management.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Kinesis data stream is a set of shards. Each shard contains a sequence of data records. A consumer is an application
that processes the data from a Kinesis data stream. You can map a Lambda function to a shared-throughput consumer (
standard iterator), or to a dedicated-throughput consumer with enhanced fan-out.
Amazon DynamoDB is the best database for this use case as it supports near-real time performance and millisecond
responsiveness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Amazon RedShift cannot provide millisecond responsiveness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Amazon Keyspaces (for Apache Cassandra) is a scalable, highly available, and managed Apache Cassandra–compatible
database service. This combined with a containerized, serverless compute layer on Amazon ECS for Fargate and a RDS for
Microsoft SQL Server database layer is a fully managed version of what currently exists on premises.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Larger data migrations with AWS DMS can include many terabytes of information. This process can be cumbersome due to
network bandwidth limits or just the sheer amount of data. AWS DMS can use Snowball Edge and Amazon S3 to migrate
large
databases more quickly than by other methods.</p>
<p>When you&#x27;re using an Edge device, the data migration process has the following stages:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You use the AWS Schema Conversion Tool (AWS SCT) to extract the data locally and move it to an Edge device.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You ship the Edge device or devices back to AWS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After AWS receives your shipment, the Edge device automatically loads its data into an Amazon S3 bucket.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AWS DMS takes the files and migrates the data to the target data store. If you are using change data capture (
CDC),
those updates are written to the Amazon S3 bucket and then applied to the target data store.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A rate-based rule tracks the rate of requests for each originating IP address, and triggers the rule action on IPs
with rates that go over a limit. You set the limit as the number of requests per 5-minute time span.</p>
<p>You can use this type of rule to put a temporary block on requests from an IP address that&#x27;s sending excessive
requests.
By default, AWS WAF aggregates requests based on the IP address from the web request origin, but you can configure the
rule to use an IP address from an HTTP header, like X-Forwarded-For, instead.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Access logs are exported to S3 but not to CloudWatch. Also, it would not be possible to block an attack from a
specific IP using a security group (while still allowing any other source access) as they do not support deny rules.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AWS Security Hub gives a comprehensive view of high-priority security alerts and compliance status, but it does not
offer data-specific detection like PHI in S3 objects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have data in sources other than Amazon S3, you can use Athena Federated Query to query the data in place or
build pipelines that extract data from multiple data sources and store them in Amazon S3. With Athena Federated Query,
you can run SQL queries across data stored in relational, non-relational, object, and custom data sources.</p>
<p>Athena uses data source connectors that run on AWS Lambda to run federated queries. A data source connector is a piece
of code that can translate between your target data source and Athena. You can think of a connector as an extension of
Athena&#x27;s query engine. Prebuilt Athena data source connectors exist for data sources like Amazon CloudWatch Logs,
Amazon
DynamoDB, Amazon DocumentDB, and Amazon RDS, and JDBC-compliant relational data sources such MySQL, and PostgreSQL
under the Apache 2.0 license.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AWS RAM（Resource Access Manager） does not apply to Reserved Instances. It is used to share other resources like
Subnets, Transit Gateways, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Amazon Transcribe converts audio input into text, which opens the door for various text analytics applications on
voice input. For instance, by using Amazon Comprehend on the converted text data from Amazon Transcribe, customers can
perform sentiment analysis or extract entities and key phrases.</p>
<p>Amazon Athena is an interactive query service that makes it easy to analyze data in Amazon S3 using standard SQL.
Athena is serverless, so there is no infrastructure to manage, and you pay only for the queries that you run.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Amazon EBS fast snapshot restore (FSR) enables you to create a volume from a snapshot that is fully initialized at
creation. This eliminates the latency of I/O operations on a block when it is accessed for the first time. Volumes
that are created using fast snapshot restore instantly deliver all their provisioned performance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Registering a wildcard custom domain name in Route 53 and creating a record pointing to API Gateway endpoint allows
you to create unique URLs for each customer under the same domain name.</p>
<p>Requesting a wildcard certificate in the same AWS region as the REST API would provide secure URLs (https) for all
customers under the same domain name. This would minimize the operational complexity of managing multiple certificates
in different regions.</p>
<p>By creating a custom domain name in API Gateway and importing the wildcard certificate from ACM, the company can
provide
secure and unique URLs for each customer. API Gateway&#x27;s custom domain names provide paths for API methods, helping
maintain a consistent experience for customers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By setting geographical restrictions on CloudFront content using a deny list, the company can block access to content
for users outside of the released regions. If a user from a blocked region attempts to access the content, they would
receive the custom error message, thereby meeting the company&#x27;s requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the EKS control plane is configured with private access, and the nodes are in a private subnet, you need to
create VPC endpoints for Amazon EKS and ECR. This allows the nodes to communicate with the EKS control plane and pull
container images from ECR.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AWS Organizations provides policy-based management for multiple AWS accounts. With Organizations, you can create
member accounts that are part of your organization and centrally manage your accounts.</p>
<p>AWS Directory Service allows you to connect your AWS resources with an existing on-premises Microsoft Active Directory
or to set up a new, stand-alone directory in the AWS Cloud. AWS Identity Center makes it easy to centrally manage
access to multiple AWS accounts and business applications and provide users with single sign-on access to all their
assigned accounts and applications from one place.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AWS Lambda is a cost-effective solution for unpredictable traffic patterns due to its pay-per-use pricing model.
DynamoDB is also a cost-effective and highly scalable solution for storing user data. The API Gateway provides a
HTTP-based endpoint that can be used to expose the Lambda function.</p>
<p>AWS Cognito User Pools provide user directory features including sign-up and sign-in services, which are suitable for
managing game user authentication.</p>
<p>AWS Amplify simplifies the process of hosting web applications with automated deployment processes. It also integrates
with CloudFront, providing a global content delivery network to efficiently serve the game interface.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can use VPC Flow Logs to capture detailed information about the traffic going to and from your Elastic Load
Balancer. Create a flow log for each network interface for your load balancer. There is one network interface per load
balancer subnet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>as EventBridge rules would invoke the job only twice a day. It also involves managing an EC2 instance, which is less
operationally efficient than the AWS Transfer Family and AWS Lambda option.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With an Aurora global database, there are two different approaches to failover depending on the scenario. You can use
manual unplanned failover (detach and promote) or managed planned failover.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MPI protocol is a message passing interface that allows multiple processes to communicate with each other.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Configure a Network ACL on the database subnet to allow all traffic from the application subnet&quot; is incorrect. This
does not restrict access specifically to the application instances.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With CloudFront Functions in Amazon CloudFront, you can write lightweight functions in JavaScript for high-scale,
latency-sensitive CDN customizations. Your functions can manipulate the requests and responses that flow through
CloudFront, perform basic authentication and authorization, generate HTTP responses at the edge, and more. CloudFront
Functions is approximately 1/6th the cost of Lambda@Edge and is extremely low latency as the functions are run on the
host in the edge location, instead of the running on a Lambda function elsewhere.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Amazon Aurora does not have an option to run a Microsoft SQL Server database, therefore this answer is not correct.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A rate-based rule tracks the rate of requests for each originating IP address, and triggers the rule action on IPs
with rates that go over a limit. You set the limit as the number of requests per 5-minute time span.</p>
<p>You can use this type of rule to put a temporary block on requests from an IP address that&#x27;s sending excessive
requests. By default, AWS WAF aggregates requests based on the IP address from the web request origin, but you can
configure the rule to use an IP address from an HTTP header, like X-Forwarded-For, instead.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AWS Control Tower automates the setup of a new landing zone using best practices blueprints for identity, federated
access, and account structure.</p>
<p>The account factory automates provisioning of new accounts in your organization. As a configurable account template,
it helps you standardize the provisioning of new accounts with pre-approved account configurations. You can configure
your account factory with pre-approved network configuration and region selections.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The architecture is already highly resilient but may be subject to performance degradation if there are sudden
increases in request rates. To resolve this situation Amazon Aurora Read Replicas can be used to serve read traffic
which offloads requests from the main database. On the frontend an Amazon CloudFront distribution can be placed in
front of the ALB and this will cache content for better performance and also offloads requests from the backend.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A CloudWatch Events rule can be used to set up automatic email notifications for Medium to High Severity findings to
the email address of your choice. You simply create an Amazon SNS topic and then associate it with an Amazon
CloudWatch events rule.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A new version of the AWS Web Application Firewall was released in November 2019. With AWS WAF classic you create “IP
match conditions”, whereas with AWS WAF (new version) you create “IP set match statements”. Look out for wording on
the exam.</p>
<p>The IP match condition / IP set match statement inspects the IP address of a web request&#x27;s origin against a set of IP
addresses and address ranges. Use this to allow or block web requests based on the IP addresses that the requests
originate from.</p>
<p>AWS WAF supports all IPv4 and IPv6 address ranges. An IP set can hold up to 10,000 IP addresses or IP address ranges
to check.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A gateway endpoint is a method of accessing S3 using private addresses from your VPC, not from your data center.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using Amazon CloudFront as the front-end provides the option to specify a custom message instead of the default
message. To specify the specific file that you want to return and the errors for which the file should be returned,
you update your CloudFront distribution to specify those values.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use AWS Compute Optimizer to obtain a recommendation for an instance type to scale vertically: This is correct because
AWS Compute Optimizer can suggest a more appropriate EC2 instance type with adequate resources for improved
performance when scaling vertically.</p>
<p>Create an Auto Scaling group and an Application Load Balancer to scale horizontally: This is correct because
horizontal scaling improves application availability by adding multiple EC2 instances. The Application Load Balancer
ensures traffic is distributed evenly across instances.</p>

<p>Tape Gateway is designed for backup and archival purposes rather than frequently accessed data. Retrieving imaging
data from virtual tapes introduces latency and does not meet the institution&#x27;s low-latency requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DAX reduces read latency but does not provide global availability or automatic replication. Manual Cross-Region
Replication adds operational complexity and is less reliable than global tables.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ECS Service Auto Scaling</p>
<ul>
<li>Automatically increase/decrease the desired number of ECS tasks</li>
<li>Amazon ECS Auto Scaling uses AWS Application Auto Scaling
• ECS Service Average CPU Utilization
• ECS Service Average Memory Utilization - Scale on RAM
• ALB Request Count Per Target – metric coming from the ALB</li>
<li>Target Tracking – scale based on target value for a specific CloudWatch metric</li>
<li>Step Scaling – scale based on a specified CloudWatch Alarm</li>
<li>Scheduled Scaling – scale based on a specified date/time (predictable changes)</li>
<li>ECS Service Auto Scaling (task level) ≠ EC2 Auto Scaling (EC2 instance level)</li>
<li>Fargate Auto Scaling is much easier to setup (because Serverless)</li>
</ul>

<p>Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP supports both SMB and NFS protocols with multi-protocol sharing and redundancy across
Availability Zones.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Storage Gateway will not accelerate replication and a volume gateway will create EBS snapshots (not S3 objects).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An S3 Lifecycle configuration is a set of rules that define actions that Amazon S3 applies to a group of objects.
There are two types of actions:</p>
<p>● Transition actions – These actions define when objects transition to another storage class. For example, you might
choose to transition objects to the S3 Standard-IA storage class 30 days after creating them, or archive objects to
the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval storage class one year after creating them. For more information, see Using Amazon
S3 storage classes.</p>
<p>● Expiration actions – These actions define when objects expire. Amazon S3 deletes expired objects on your behalf.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you cannot create a deny rule with a security group, only allow rules can be created.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is correct because resource policies in API Gateway allow you to restrict access to APIs by specifying
conditions, such as IP addresses. By creating a resource policy with a condition that permits traffic only from the
trusted IP range, you can ensure that the API is accessible only from the company’s internal network.</p>
